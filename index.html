<h4>Hello, I am Cory Johnson</h4>
<h3>and here is my first webpage</h3>
<p>
Neil Armstrong is known for the quote "One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind", which is very significant in the sense that no human had walked on the moon before. What isn't know is the amount of work and effort put into the project of building the rocket and launching it while mission control monitored almost all aspects of the launch and pilot. My intention for producing and managing internet based content is similar to this. I want to partake in an effort that would achieve a feat that would make a user feel like they just landed on the moon within some aspect of their life and this website marks my first step in this. Below is a picture of a bunny.
