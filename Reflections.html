<p>The article details the efforts made by microsoft to identify areas where a computer is losing battery life over unnecessary or preventable things. Examples used in the article were a website’s HTML, CSS, or javascript coding. Sometimes the website demands cause a computer to focus more on processing what is to be displayed and how. This didn’t get too much detail as to how their Energy Estimation Engine (E3) would work to fix issues for the website’s internal workings, but did mention that their labs are constantly testing and monitoring user activity to get data on where computers fail to perform optimally. 
Limiting background tasks from unused browser tabs was noted as a strategy, but nothing direct. This makes sense as, for most users, they often view things one at a time, and to have a computer constantly run the same operations as if the content was present or not is counter to efficient processing. Other factors like animations and ads and the use of flash were listed as things microsoft pursued to drastically decrease power consumption. The interface was said to be designed for the least amount of power usage. By optimizing the animation for one of their button resulted in a 75% decrease in GPU usage. These small tasks from showing content to using interfaces should not be used as examples for improving performance. I say this because as someone with a background in engineering, the more efficient in a given system the better the system will be!
My takeaway here is if I truly care about the experience my future websites offer, one sure way to ruin that experience is carelessly using multiple features without regard to its demand on hardware.
